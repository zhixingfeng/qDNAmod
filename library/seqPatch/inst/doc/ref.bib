    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA modifications have been found in a wide range of living organisms, from bacteria to human. Many existing studies have shown that they play important roles in development, disease, bacteria virulence, etc. However, for many types of DNA modification, for example N6-methyladenine and 8-oxoG, there is not an efficient and accurate detection method. Single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing not only generates DNA sequences, but also generates DNA polymerase kinetic information. The kinetic information is sensitive to DNA modifications in the sequenced DNA template, and therefore can be used for detecting a wide range of DNA modification types. The usual detection strategy is a case-control method, which compare kinetic information between native sample and a control sample whose modifications have been removed. However, generating a control sample doubles the cost. We proposed a hierarchical model, which can incorporate existing SMRT sequencing data to increase detection accuracy and reduce coverage requirement of control sample or even avoid the need of a control sample in some cases. We tested our method on SMRT sequencing data of plasmids with known modified sites and <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain to demonstrate our method can greatly increase detection accuracy and reduce sequencing cost.</p>},
